1. Always analyze the constraints first
i.e. When you see "sorted array," immediately ask: "What does being sorted give me for free?"

2. Look for the "minimal information needed" pattern
Your first solution tracked lastSeen globally, but the sorted property means you only ever need to know about the immediately previous element. 
Ask yourself: "What's the smallest amount of state I need to track?"

3. Practice the "constraint-driven simplification" mindset
For each constraint, think: "How does this change my approach?"

4. Study similar problems
You'll see solution components reused and combined in different ways
